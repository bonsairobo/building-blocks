# Examples

The `examples/` directory is not in the `building-blocks` cargo workspace, so to run an example, you need to `cd examples`
before running `cargo run --example foo`.

All examples use the Bevy engine. This list is roughly ordered by complexity.

## SDF Mesh

A simple example of how to generate a mesh from signed distance voxels.

```sh
cargo run --example sdf_mesh
```

## Mesh Showcase

A showcase of all the meshing algorithms, fetching samples from a `ChunkMap`.

```sh
cargo run --example mesh_showcase
```

Use the left and right arrow keys to select one of the example shapes to be meshed. Use the W key to toggle wireframe mode and the F key to toggle the flat shading mode.

## Quad Mesh UVs

A `greedy_quads` mesh of a cube with UV coordinates mapped on all faces. This is useful for seeing that textures are oriented
correctly.

```sh
cargo run --example quad_mesh_uvs
```

## Array Texture Materials

Shows how to use an "array texture" to give each type of a voxel a different material.

```sh
cargo run --example array_texture_materials
```

## LOD Terrain

A larger scale example of terrain generated with 3D fractional brownian motion
([SIMDnoise](https://docs.rs/simdnoise/3.1.6/simdnoise/) crate). The further chunks are from the camera, the more they get
downsampled. Chunk meshes are dynamically generated as the camera moves.

You can run with either a blocky map or a smooth map.
```sh
cargo run --example lod_terrain blocky
cargo run --example lod_terrain smooth
```
